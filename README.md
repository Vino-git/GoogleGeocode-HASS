# Google Geocode

This component has been created to be used with Home Assistant.

Google geocode is the process of converting device tracker location into a human-readable address.

The sensor will update the address each time the device tracker location changes. If the device tracker is in a zone it will display the zone.

### Installation:

Copy the google_geocode.py file and place it in <config_dir>/custom_components/sensor/google_geocode.py.
